# React-Native-Tests
React Native test projects that I worked on between January 2020 and March 2020. Specifically, "map-proto-2" was intended to be a Google Maps clone written in React Native for a Software Engineering project. However, due to COVID-19 complications that part of the project was cancelled by my professor.
